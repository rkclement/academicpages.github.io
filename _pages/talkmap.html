<p>This map shows locations where I have given a presntation, led a workshop, or presented a poster. It is generated from a Jupyter Notebook file in <a href="https://github.com/rkclement/rkclement.github.io/_talks/talkmap.ipynb">/_talks/talkmap.ipynb</a>, which mines the location fields in the .md files in _talks/.</p>
