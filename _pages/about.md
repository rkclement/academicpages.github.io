I am currently the Data Services Librarian at [Middlebury College](https://go.middlebury.edu/library), in Middlebury, VT. I've been here since the fall of 2015. Before that, I was the Data Services Librarian at [Reed College](https://library.reed.edu), in Portland, OR.

As the Data Services Librarian, I provide general research and technology assistance to students, faculty, and staff at Middlebury, and specialized assistance to those working with data, particularly in the social sciences and humanities. I help with projects involving finding, acquiring, managing, interpreting, analyzing, and visualizing data. I also provide leadership in the development of digital scholarship support at the College. I have worked on support for text analysis, digitization, and qualitative data analysis.

I also serve as the subject specialist in the library for the economics, geography, philosophy, and sociology/anthropology departments, and serve as Middlebury's Government Documents Coordinator. At Reed College, I served as the subject specialist for the psychology and philosophy departments.

In addition to my work with data services and digital scholarship support, I also work on library user experience, service design, and assessment. I am interested in the critical perspectives on both information and data literacy.
