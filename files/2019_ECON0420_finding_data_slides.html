class: middle

# what are we covering today?

* organizing your data search
* codebooks
* some important data sources
* dirty, unprepared data

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# before you start

---
class: center, middle

# Structure of a dataset

Data files (What format? How many? How are they organized?)

Scripts to process the data (sometimes, e.g. .do files, etc)

Codebook

---
class: center, middle

# Structure of a data file

Rows and columns - what is in each *ideally*?

Different types of variables -- id vs observation (e.g. what vs how much)

Variable names (machine vs human readable?)

Missing data

---
class: center, middle

# Structure of a codebook

Column locations and widths for each variable (if necessary)

What universe does the data cover?

Response codes for each variable, along with nonresponse or missing data

Exact questions and skip patterns (if it is a complex survey)

etc...

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# organizing your search

---
class: center, middle

# Think of what you need

What variables do I need?

What level of observation do I need? Do I need aggregate data or microdata?

What time period/frequency do I need?

---
class: center, middle

# Who has what you need?

"Who cares about this enough to collect and/or keep it?"

What type of organization are they? Educational, governmental, private, etc?

If not public/government organization, how valuable is the data?

Are there privacy/confidentiality issues?

---
class: center, middle

# Searching for data on Google?

Not the place to *start*.

Remember the "who would care rule" -- look for them!

Be as specific as possible in search terms (e.g. "microdata," "by county," etc.)

---
class: middle

# What are they types of studies

* Cross-sectional
  * Collected only once, but may be for many different individuals/households/firms
  * Many public opinion surveys are cross-sectional
  
* Time Series
  * Studies the same variable(s) over time
  * The Census or the National Health Interview Study are examples
  * The questions/variables *and* the group studied remain mostly the same over time, but they individual respondents may vary
  
* Longitudinal Studies (e.g. Panel Studies)
  * Conducted repeatedly for the same group of respondents over time
  * Allows examining changes over the lifespan
  * Panel Study of Income Dynamics is an example

# (some) data sources

---
class: middle

# The Census/American Community Survey

* Some access points:
  * [Social Explorer](http://go.middlebury.edu/socialexplorer) (for tables and many different geographies)
  * IPUMS (historical, harmonized, microdata)
  * [NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/) (historical spatial data)
  * [The Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/)

class: middle

# Tips for working with the Census

* When working with historical/time series data:
  * Watch for changing values
  * Watch for changing geographic coverage
  * Watch for changing questions
  * [Racebox](http://racebox.org/)

* Which ACS is right for you?
  * 1-, 3-, or 5-year ACS
  * The 3-year ACS is going away

# Add Health

* &lt;https://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth&gt;
* Longitudinal study of students in grades 7-12 in 1994-95 (most recent follow up in 2008)
* Survey data on social, economic, psychological and physical well-being
  * Contextual data on family, neighborhood, community, school, friendships, peer groups, and romantic relationships
* Public use and restricted versions of the data; public use available through ICPSR

---
class: middle

# Other government sources
* [Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](http://www.bea.gov/)
* [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](http://www.bls.gov/)
* Federal Reserve Economic Data ([FRED](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/)/[ALFRED](https://alfred.stlouisfed.org/))
