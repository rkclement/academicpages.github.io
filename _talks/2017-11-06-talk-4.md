Unlike much traditional scholarship in the humanities and social sciences, digital scholarship and digital humanities projects often require support teams with a wide range of expertise from across the institution. Libraries play key roles at many stages of a digital projectâ€™s lifecycle, from consultation, to training, to project management. Although some features of successful models for collaboration will be unique to the institution, many strategies will be widely applicable in the liberal arts context. In this discussion, leaders will briefly describe three recent examples of successful collaborations at Middlebury College: the first is a pilot program for hosting and supporting Omeka &amp; Neatline instances from conception to preservation; the second is a four-day Liberal Arts Data Bootcamp that introduced faculty and academic staff to data management basics and demonstrated ways that data is or might be applied in the liberal arts context (e.g. data visualization, mapping, and text mining); the third is the in-process development of a digital repository, hosting faculty/student/staff scholarship, including articles, datasets, and materials from Special Collections and Archives.
