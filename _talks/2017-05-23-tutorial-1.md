Successful outreach on topics such as working with and managing research data can be challenging when faced with novice users. Participants in this workshop will learn about v 1.0 (2015) and 2.0 (2016) of a multi-day Data Bootcamp for novice users in the humanities and humanistic social sciences that was held at Middlebury College. This workshop covered topics such as managing, cleaning, and documenting data, as well as data visualization, mapping, and working with textual data. In addition to discussion about what worked for Middlebury, participants will work together to determine audience needs, learning objectives, and tools. Potential workshop plans will focus on active learning methods and free and/or open-source tools and data to increase accessibility. Participants will also be able to access and share workshop materials from an Open Science Framework project.
