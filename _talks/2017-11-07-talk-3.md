Middlebury College is engaged in a collaborative effort between librarians, ITS, and faculty to define, plan, and implement a digital preservation and access system that answers the varied needs across multiple disciplines. We discuss the challenges, strategies, and insights encountered throughout this process, including our participation in DLFâ€™s eResearch Network. (With Wendy Shook, Science Data Librarian @ Middlebury College, and Patrick Wallace, Digital Projects and Archives Librarian @ Middlebury College)
