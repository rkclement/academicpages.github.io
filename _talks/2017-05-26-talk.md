*A [PechaKucha](https://www.pechakucha.org/) talk.*

Data librarians consult with and advise users every day on best practices and tools for managing, wrangling, and working with data. As we look to our own extensive stores of data on our collections, users, finances, and more, though, it seems we have rarely listened to ourselves when it comes to these topics. In this short talk I covered:

1. historical challenges with the management of library data
2. Middlebury College&apos;s Library Data Project and the tools we are using to address these challenges
3. A call to &quot;take our own advice&quot; when it comes to managing and working with our internal data.
