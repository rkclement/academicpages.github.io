*With Patrick Wallace.*

As part of a broad, ongoing effort to coordinate digital scholarship efforts across multiple campuses and disparate administrative units, Middlebury College has launched MiddLab - a &quot;library DevOps&quot; team charged with institutionalizing the iterative development and rapid integration of new digital scholarship tools and services. [Our slides](https://rkclement.github.io/2017_dlf_middlabPresentation/presentation.html) are available, as well.
