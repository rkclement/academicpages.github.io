This past October, three librarians ([Ryan Clement, Data Services Librarian](http://go.middlebury.edu/ryan); [Leanne Galletly, User Experience & Digital Scholarship Librarian](http://go.middlebury.edu/leanne); [Wendy Shook, Science Data Librarian](http://go.middlebury.edu/wshook)) travelled to the [Digital Library Federation (DLF) Forum](https://forum2018.diglib.org/) in Henderson, NV. The Middlebury Library has been a member institution of the DLF for years, and Midd Librarians regularly travel to DLF's annual Forum each fall. This conference is a model of what inclusive, practicioner-focused, and innovative library conferences can be.

While you can find slidedecks, notes, and other materials from the Forum in [DLF's Open Science Framework repository](https://forum2018.diglib.org/livestream-recordings/), and [recordings of the opening and closing plenary sessions](https://forum2018.diglib.org/livestream-recordings/) on the Forum website, we wanted to share some of the sessions and takeaways that seemed most interesting to us.

The day before the conference started, Wendy and Ryan attended the inaugural Learn@DLF day, a pre-conference that was entirely workshops. A workshop on the [DLF Project Manager's Toolkit](https://wiki.diglib.org/DLF_Project_Managers_Toolkit) introduced some new tools and strategies for managing projects, though most of the attendees were working on projects a much greater scale than we do here at Middlebury. An afternoon workshop on Digital Mapping Ecosystems introduced some techniques for bringing together the power of Mapbox and Carto to create great online maps, but then took us beyond this to make our own interactive interfaces for our maps using Javascript and the Mapbox API. There was good discussion of the balance between easy to use, but proprietary products (like Carto and Mapbox), and teaching students to write (or at least edit) code and work with open source tools. The former will obviously help us get results faster, but the latter will teach the students important digital literacies they will benefit from for far longer.  

A session on [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/) discussed the development of Wax, a framework and set of tools that allow users to create useful and preservable digital archives without a database. Examples of projects developed using Wax include [Style Revolution](https://stylerevolution.github.io/) and the [Barbara Curtis Adachi Bunraku Collection](https://bunraku.library.columbia.edu/). Wax uses the Jekyll engine to quickly create static, low-maintenance sites without the overhead of platforms like WordPress or Omeka.  

There were a number of sessions discussing copyright, access, and usage rights, and how these affect the ability of libraries and scholars to do digital scholarship. A session on [RightsStatements.org](https://rightsstatements.org/en/) discussed the need for though of us creating digital works, and digitizing analog works, to make sure we are being clear in the statements we provide to users on their rights to re-use our cultural heritage works. On the flipside, a talk about the legal literacies needed for text/data mining highlighted University of [British Columbia's useful webpage on "What am I NOT allowed to do with electronic resources?"](https://licenses.library.ubc.ca/) -- often library electronic resources have licenses that are hidden from users, but by bringing them into the open we can help users understand what they can and *can't* do with these resources. This presenter also discussed the importance of not only knowing users' rights under the law, but also negotiating our licenses and contracts so that they don't actively *take away* these rights.  

A session on teaching and tactics for working with students on digital scholarship projects began with a discussion of a project using anti-semitic tweets as primary source material for a project. The presenter spoke of the challenges of finding the material herself, given the absolute depravity of anti-semitic Twitter. She also said, though, that it was an effective project, as it helped students who had been studying historical antisemitism and propaganda a powerful chance to connect what they had been learning to our current landscape. Another presenter in this session, Megan Martinsen from Georgetown University, gave us her "10 Practical Tips for Executing Collaborative Models" -- these tips, while familiar to some, are great reminders of things we need to make sure we are doing as we look to collaborate across departments, workgroups, and institutions. Ryan's favorite tip is shown below.
