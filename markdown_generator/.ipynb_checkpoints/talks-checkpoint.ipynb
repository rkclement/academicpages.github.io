As we look to our own extensive stores of data on our collections, users, finances, and more, though, it seems we have rarely listened to ourselves when it comes to these topics. In this short talk I covered: 1. historical challenges with the management of library data; 2.

In addition to discussion about what worked for Middlebury, participants will work together to determine audience needs, learning objectives, and tools.

      "Collaborating across units and institutions to support digital scholarship,Talk,talk-4,Digital Library Federation Forum Liberal Arts Pre-conference 2016,11/6/17,\"Milwaukee, WS\",,\"Unlike much traditional scholarship in the humanities and social sciences, digital scholarship and digital humanities projects often require support teams with a wide range of expertise from across the institution. Libraries play key roles at many stages of a digital project’s lifecycle, from consultation, to training, to project management. Although some features of successful models for collaboration will be unique to the institution, many strategies will be widely applicable in the liberal arts context. In this discussion, leaders will briefly describe three recent examples of successful collaborations at Middlebury College: the first is a pilot program for hosting and supporting Omeka & Neatline instances from conception to preservation; the second is a four-day Liberal Arts Data Bootcamp that introduced faculty and academic staff to data management basics and demonstrated ways that data is or might be applied in the liberal arts context (e.g. data visualization, mapping, and text mining); the third is the in-process development of a digital repository, hosting faculty/student/staff scholarship, including articles, datasets, and materials from Special Collections and Archives.

      "NW5C research data management & curation workshop: A collaborative model for liberal arts colleges,Talk,talk-6,Digital Library Federation Forum Liberal Arts Pre-conference 2015,10/25/15,\"Vancouver, BC\",,\"In this presentation, we discuss a team-based workshop on data management and curation organized by librarians from the five liberal arts colleges in the Northwest Five Consortium: Willamette University, Whitman College, University of Puget Sound, Reed College, and Lewis & Clark College. The consortium supports collaborative sharing of experience and expertise in support of the core value of integrating teaching and scholarship. Liberal arts data management support faces many of the same challenges, such as issues of scalability and outreach, that other innovative projects face in such environments. We envisioned this workshop as a place to take advantage of the close-knit community structures of liberal arts colleges and bring many of the stakeholders in research data management together to collaborate at a broader consortial level. The model for the workshop was a team from each institution connected to a specific research project: a faculty researcher, one or two student researchers, a librarian, and, optionally, a representative from IT or other technical support. Pre-workshop preparation in the form of a Data Curation Profile interview was used to elucidate the data issues of their team and to help shape the workshop structure. The workshop presented the big-picture challenges and best practices of research data management, and then allowed teams to work on applying these ideas to their own projects. Central to our conception of this workshop was the involvement of undergraduate student researchers in the discussion and implementation of research data management within their groups’ research projects. By involving undergraduate students as well as researchers, IT/tech support, and librarians in a collaborative, cross-campus discussion of research data management best practices and their applications for current research projects, we hope to improve the research data management infrastructure and implementation on our campuses and to consider new avenues for collaboration.

In this session, we will present how we have used the concepts in ACRL’s draft Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education to guide conversations with faculty about teaching research competencies at Reed College. The Framework and its presentation of threshold concepts is particularly useful for developing discipline-specific teaching strategies and approaches when working with core and gateway courses. The session will include the content we developed in collaboration with faculty for courses in music, anthropology, history, and psychology.
